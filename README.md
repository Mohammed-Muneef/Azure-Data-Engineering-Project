# Azure Data Engineering End-to-End Pipeline Project

Welcome to the repository for my Azure Data Engineering end-to-end pipeline project. This project demonstrates a comprehensive data pipeline solution built using Azure's powerful tools, designed to handle complex data workflows and generate valuable insights.

## Overview

This project showcases the complete lifecycle of a data pipeline, from data ingestion to visualization, using various Azure services. It leverages the AdventureWorks sample dataset from Azure SQL Database to illustrate the pipeline's capabilities.

## Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - **Azure Data Factory**: Streamlines data collection from diverse sources and orchestrates data workflows.

2. **Data Storage**
   - **Azure Data Lake Gen 2**: Provides secure and scalable storage for raw and processed data, enabling efficient data management.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Azure Databricks**: Facilitates efficient data processing and transformation using a Spark-based environment.

4. **Data Analysis**
   - **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Combines big data and data warehousing capabilities to perform advanced analytics and complex queries.

5. **Visualization**
   - **Power BI**: Creates interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Account**: Ensure you have an Azure account and access to the necessary Azure services.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Set up and configure Data Factory pipelines.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen 2**: Provision a Data Lake Storage account.
- **Azure Databricks**: Create and configure a Databricks workspace.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Set up a Synapse workspace and configure data sources.
- **Power BI**: Install Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation.

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Create a new pipeline in Azure Data Factory to collect data from the AdventureWorks sample dataset.

2. **Data Storage**
   - Configure Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for data storage and ensure appropriate access permissions.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Set up Azure Databricks notebooks to perform data processing and transformations.

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Use Azure Synapse Analytics to query and analyze the transformed data.

5. **Visualization**
   - Design Power BI dashboards to visualize the results and insights derived from the data analysis.
